// of its own needs no install and no download. The codex product carries
// none of it.

// The Dart code's symbols are saved as it is built, to build\symbols\
// app.windows-x64.symbols: the hang reports name its frames by their

// `llvm-symbolizer --obj=` that file turns into functions and lines. Only
// saved: the app's own stack traces stay as they were, named.
//
// The installer lands in build/installers/; beside it, remote\<VERSION>\,
// the remote server's gzipped builds, which the app downloads instead of
// carrying them (tool/build_remote_server.dart), to upload with the
// release.
